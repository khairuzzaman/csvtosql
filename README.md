# csv to sql
This is a sample c# based library. The purpose of the library is to read data from csv file and insert/update the data to a sql table.

This file can handle small csv file and dump the data to sql server table. We use the following library in this project.

If you want to run the test project, create a database named csvToSql in sql server and update the database connection script.
